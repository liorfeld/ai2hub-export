| Signal | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Experience | First-hand usage descriptions, personal insights, specific examples |
| Expertise | Technical accuracy, industry terminology, depth of coverage |
| Authoritativeness | Citations, statistics, expert quotes, comprehensive coverage |
| Trustworthiness | Honest pros/cons, balanced perspective, no false claims |

**Core Web Vitals Compliance**:

- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): Specify image dimensions always

### Semantic SEO Implementation

**Topic Cluster Approach**:
- Cover topic comprehensively

**Search Intent Alignment**:

| Intent | Content Approach |
|--------|-----------------|
| Informational | Educational, comprehensive, FAQ-rich |
| Commercial | Comparison-focused, benefit-driven |
| Transactional | CTA-heavy, urgency-appropriate |
| Navigational | Clear brand focus, direct answers |

### Content Structure for SEO

**Heading Hierarchy**:
```
H1: Primary Keyword + Compelling Hook (1 per article)
  H2: Major Section (keyword variation) - 5-7 per article
    H3: Subsection (supporting detail) - 2-4 per H2
      H4: Deep detail (rarely needed)
```

**Paragraph Standards**:
- 2-3 sentences per paragraph
- 40-80 words per paragraph
- One main idea per paragraph
- Mobile-first readability

**Word Count Guidelines**:
| Content Type | Minimum | Optimal |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Product Review | 1200 | 1500-2000 |
| Comparison Article | 1500 | 2000-2500 |

## LLM SEO / GEO Optimization

### Understanding AI Citation

AI systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude) select content for citation based on:

| Factor | Weight | Implementation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Topical Authority | High | Comprehensive topic coverage |
| Content Freshness | High | Recent publication/update dates |
| Factual Density | High | Statistics, data, specific numbers |
| Clear Structure | Medium | Proper headings, organized content |
| Quotability | Medium | Standalone answer paragraphs |
| Brand Mentions | Medium | Recognized brand/source names |

### Citation-Optimized Content Structure

**Answer-First Architecture**:

Every H2 section should begin with a 40-60 word "answer block" that:
- Directly answers the implied question
- Can stand alone as a citation
- Contains key facts/statistics
- Is independently understandable

**Example**:
```html
<h2>How Long Does Installation Take?</h2>

<p>Installation typically takes 10-15 minutes for most users. The process includes downloading the software (2 minutes), running the installer (5 minutes), and completing initial configuration (3-5 minutes). No technical expertise is required, and the guided wizard handles all complex settings automatically.</p>
```

### Quotable Content Elements

**Statistics Format**:
```
"According to [Year] data, [Metric] shows [Number/Percentage] improvement in [Outcome]."
```

**Definition Format**:
```
"[Term] is [clear definition in 15-25 words that can be extracted as a standalone answer]."
```

**Comparison Format**:
```
"Compared to [Alternative], [Subject] offers [Specific Advantage] with [Quantifiable Difference]."
```

### FAQ Optimization for AI

FAQs are critical for AI citation. Format for maximum citation potential:

**Structure**:
```html
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is [Product/Topic]?</h3>
<p>[40-60 word direct answer that AI can extract and cite]</p>

<h3>How does [Product] compare to [Competitor]?</h3>
<p>[Specific comparison with data points]</p>

<h3>Is [Product] worth the investment?</h3>
<p>[Value-focused answer with specific benefits]</p>
```

**Question Types to Include**:
- Definition questions ("What is...?")
- Comparison questions ("How does X compare to Y?")
- Process questions ("How do I...?")
- Value questions ("Is it worth...?")
- Specification questions ("What are the requirements?")

### Content for Zero-Click Optimization

Since 60%+ of searches end without a click, optimize for visibility even without traffic:

**Featured Snippet Targeting**:
- Answer questions in first 40-60 words
- Use lists and tables for process/comparison queries
- Format definitions clearly
- Include the question in or near the answer

**AI Overview Optimization**:
- Comprehensive topic coverage
- Multiple perspectives presented
- Statistics and data included
- Clear, extractable conclusions

### Entity Optimization

**Knowledge Graph Presence**:
- Use consistent brand/product naming
- Link to authoritative sources (Wikipedia, official sites)
- Include `sameAs` properties in schema
- Mention recognized entities naturally

### HTML Image Formatting

```html
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
  <img 
    src="[IMAGE_URL]" 
    alt="[DESCRIPTIVE_ALT_TEXT_50-125_CHARS]"
    width="[WIDTH]"
    height="[HEIGHT]"
    loading="lazy"
  />
  <figcaption>[CONTEXTUAL_CAPTION_ADDING_VALUE]</figcaption>
</figure>
```

**Alt Text Requirements**:
- 50-125 characters

alt="Dashboard interface showing real-time analytics and conversion tracking."

<!-- Bad -->
alt="image of dashboard"
alt="product photo"
alt="screenshot"
```

### Featured Image (LCP) Special Handling

The featured image is the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element. Special rules:

```html
<!-- Featured image - NO lazy loading, HIGH priority -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
  <img 
    src="[FEATURED_IMAGE_URL]" 
    alt="[COMPREHENSIVE_ALT_TEXT]"
    width="1200"

## SCRIBE Methodology

### Core Philosophy

**SCRIBE** (Sophisticated Content Rendering with Intelligent Behavioral Emulation) creates content that authentically mimics human authorship. The goal is natural, engaging content that passes AI detection through genuine quality, not tricks.

### Writer Personas

Select persona based on article type and tone:

**The Passionate Practitioner**
- Use for: Personal tone, reviews, recommendations
- Style: First-person, anecdotal, honest enthusiasm
- Example: "I've been using this for three months, and here's what surprised me..."

**The Industry Innovator**
- Use for: Innovative tone, tech products, trends
- Style: Forward-thinking, analytical yet accessible
- Example: "The landscape is shifting faster than most realize..."

**The Research Enthusiast**
- Use for: Comparative tone, technical analysis
- Style: Objective, methodical, data-referenced
- Example: "After testing across 15 different scenarios, patterns emerged..."

**The Creative Problem Solver**
- Use for: Educational tone, complex solutions
- Style: Story-driven, metaphorical, transformation-focused
- Example: "Imagine you're facing this exact situation..."

**The Customer Advocate**
- Use for: Conversational tone, service products
- Style: Empathetic, benefit-focused, reassuring
- Example: "Look, I get it. You're tired of solutions that overpromise..."

### Anti-AI Detection Techniques

**Sentence Rhythm Variation**:
```
BAD (AI-like):
"The product offers excellent features. It provides great value. Users appreciate its functionality."

GOOD (Human-like):
"Here's what struck me first - the interface just makes sense. You know how some tools require a manual to do anything? Not this one."
```

**Natural Imperfections**:
- Sentence fragments for emphasis. Like this.
- Self-corrections: "Takes about 10 minutes - well, maybe 15 if you're thorough."
- Colloquialisms: "pretty solid", "kind of amazing"
- Hedging: "tends to", "generally", "in most cases"
- Asides: "(trust me on this)", "(who knew?)"

**Emotional Authenticity**:
- Surprise: "I wasn't expecting this, but..."
- Satisfaction: "This is exactly what I needed"
- Mild frustration: "The only thing that bugs me..."
- Curiosity: "What's fascinating here is..."

### Paragraph Architecture

**Mobile-First Structure**:
- 2-3 sentences maximum per paragraph
- One main idea per paragraph
- White space between sections
- Scannable on small screens

**Flow Techniques**:
- Open loops: "There's one feature that changed everything. (I'll get to that.)"
- Callbacks: "Remember that simplicity I mentioned? Here's where it shines..."
- Transitions: "That said...", "Here's where it gets interesting...", "On the flip side..."

### Language Variation by Target

**English**:
- Mix contractions and full forms
- Occasional idioms: "at the end of the day", "when push comes to shove"
- Varied starters: "Look,", "Here's the thing:", "Bottom line:"

**Spanish**:
- Natural subjunctive mood
- Regional awareness (European vs. Latin American)
- Warm, expressive tone

**Italian**:
- Appropriate formality levels
- Cultural references
- Expressive phrasing

**French**:
- Use "en fait", "d'ailleurs", "bref" naturally
- Appropriate formality
- Cultural appropriateness

**German**:
- Natural compound words
- Technical precision
- Appropriate formal/informal balance
